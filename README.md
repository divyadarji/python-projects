Welcome to my collection of Python projects! This repository contains various Python scripts and applications.
Below are instructions on how to set up your environment and install the necessary packages to run these projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you'll need to set up your development environment. Follow the instructions below to create a virtual environment and install the required packages.

## Setting Up the Environment

2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for these projects. To create a virtual environment, run:

    ```bash
      python -m venv env

3. Activate the Virtual Environment
